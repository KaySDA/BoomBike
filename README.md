# BoomBike

A bike-sharing service provider in the United States, BoomBikes, has been facing significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To adapt to the changing market landscape, they aim to develop a strategic plan that can boost their revenue once the pandemic subsides and the economy rebounds.

In an effort to achieve this, BoomBikes seeks to gauge the potential demand for shared bikes once the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions are lifted. Their goal is to proactively prepare to meet the needs of the public when the situation improves and distinguish themselves from other service providers, thereby maximizing profits.

To accomplish this, BoomBikes has engaged a consulting firm to identify the key factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. Their specific objectives are:

**Determine the significant variables that predict the demand for shared bikes.
Assess how well these variables can explain fluctuations in bike demand.**

BoomBikes has collected a comprehensive dataset that includes daily bike demand information across the American market, along with various factors such as meteorological data and societal trends.

Business Goal:
Task is to create a model that can predict the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. This model will assist the management in gaining insights into how demand varies with different features. By understanding these demand dynamics, the management can adjust their business strategy to meet customer expectations and adapt to changing market conditions. Furthermore, the model will provide valuable insights for understanding demand patterns in a new market.
